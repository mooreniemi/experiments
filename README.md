experiments
===========

Just where I goof around with various katas or exercises. Don't judge me too harshly here: I do these in my spare time to keep myself sharp, so they're not all very tidy. :)

Most of the code actually just lives with its own spec in `/spec` dir.

Sometimes I write up my observations from an exercise [on my blog](mooreniemi.github.io).
